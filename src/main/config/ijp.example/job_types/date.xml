    <!-- 
      A simple batch job that runs the system date command.
      It requires no datasets, and has no options.
    -->
    <name>date</name>
    <!--
      Some batch systems (e.g. Condor) interpret the executable relative to the job's
      working directory; so for a system command the absolute path is required.
    -->

    <type>batch</type>
    <!-- Job-only jobs can explicitly use "none (job only)" as their datasetType,
         but it is OK to omit the element completely 
    <datasetTypes>none (job only)</datasetTypes>
